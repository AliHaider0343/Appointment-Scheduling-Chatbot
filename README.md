# Appointment Scheduling Chatbot
This project focuses on creating a chatbot for scheduling appointments efficiently. The chatbot streamlines the appointment booking process, allowing users to specify their preferred date, time, and service. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), the chatbot understands user requests and interacts in a conversational manner. It integrates with scheduling systems to check availability and confirm appointments seamlessly. The user-friendly interface simplifies the booking process, enhancing user experience and reducing administrative overhead. With this chatbot, scheduling appointments becomes convenient and hassle-free for both users and businesses alike.
